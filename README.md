The repo aims to store the codes for problem sets for Stats 507.

For the file PS2Q3(https://github.com/xizxz/Stats507/blob/master/PS2Q3.ipynb), we read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES. After adding four cohorts, the dataset can be used as the preparation and start point for analyses in future problem sets.
